# DataStructureAndAlgorithms
### Notes of learning data structure and algorithms 

1. C# Collections: Array, ArrayList, List<T>, LinkedList<T>, Queue<T>, Stack<T>, HashTable, HashSet, Dictionary<K, T>

    - Array: items are consecutive in memory, of same type, get by index, size is fixed 
    - ArrayList: dynamic size, allow different types, not type-safe, boxing and unboxing 
    - List<T>: type-safe, no boxing and unboxing (mostly searching)
    - LinkedList<T>: better to insert/delete, no accessing through index (used if often modifying)
    - Queue<T>: First in first out (FIFO)
    - Stack<T>: Last in first out (LIFO)
    - HashTable: Value is object (Has boxing/unboxing), thread-safe
    - HashSet: no repeatable items
    - Dictionary<K, T>: type-safe

2. C# Delegate and Event
